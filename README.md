# Crescent School of Gaming Stack Rewrite

This is a rewrite of the Crescent School of Gaming's current "stack," which is just a Microsoft Access database.
The rewrite will use Next.js, PostgreSQL, Drizzle, Auth.js, Typescript, & TailwindCSS.
This project was also built with Create T3 App.

        - [ ] Perhaps create your own.
